# `09` Array of blog titles

# 📝 Instructions

Using the same endpoint from the previous exercise, create a function `get_titles` that returns the titles of all the posts found in the response body.

## 💡Hint

1. Create the function `get_titles`.
2. Declare a new empty array called `titles`.
3. Do the request to the endpoint inside of the function.
4. Loop each post from the list of posts.
5. Get the title of each post.
6. Add that title to the new array.
7. Return the titles array.

The console output should be something similar to this:

```python
['title 1','title 2', 'title 3']
```
