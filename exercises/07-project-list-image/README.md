```

## üí°Hint

1. Do a GET request to the endpoint.
2. Use the [.json() method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_response.asp) to get the response body as a dictionary.
3. Find the last project on the list.
4. Find the last image of that project.
5. Print the image URL on the console.
6. No need to loop, just use the numerical positions (index) to access the information
