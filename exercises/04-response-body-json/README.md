# `04` Response JSON

But having a text based response is not very usefull, that is why API's normally respond in CSV, JSON, YAML or XML.

# üìù Instructions

The following endpoint returns the current time in a JSON format every time it is requested using the GET method.

```python
GET: https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/fake/sample/time.php

Response body (application/json):

{
    "hours": "07",
    "minutes": "29",
    "seconds": "35"
}
```

Please do a GET request to that endpoint and print what the time on the console with this format:

```bash
Current time: 17 hrs 06 min and 23 sec
```

## üí°Hint

1. Use the [.json() method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_response.asp) to get the response body as a dictionary
2. Get the `hours`, `minutes` and `seconds` properties from the object
3. Concatenate everything together like this: `Current time: 17 hrs 06 min and 23 sec`
